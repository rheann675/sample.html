    <h1>fare well</h1>

    They say the ice will hold <br>
    so there I go, <br>
    forced to believe them by my act of trusting people, <br>
    stepping out on it, <br>
    
    and naturally it gaps open <br>
    and I, forced to carry on coolly <br>
    by my act of being imperturbable, <br>
    slide erectly into the water wearing my captain's helmet, <br>
    waving to the shore with a sad smile, <br>
    "Goodbye my darlings, goodbye dear one," <br>
    as the ice meets again over my head with a click. </p>
